The technical details about this site.

# Static Site Generator

THe website is built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I modified the [tufte-jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) theme inspired by [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.github.io).

This site is written in [valid HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjjiang.me).

# Performance Metrics

I try to keep the site as simple as possible. The table below shows Google's Lighthouse audit scores. I will be trying to gradually improve the scores in the future.

| Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| 60 | 93 | 86 | 80 |
